_**This project is a final project for the IT technician degree.**_

The management of vehicles and appointments in a driving school is often chaotic. Spontaneously canceled appointments often lapse, as it is difficult in everyday working life to find a replacement via phone calls, WhatsApp and other channels. Also with the
vehicle allocation, there is often unnecessary administrative work, for example when
scheduling a trailer for trailer driving hours.

In order to meet these challenges, an app is to be developed that
offers driving schools various management options. The app makes it possible to
efficiently manage appointments between learner drivers and driving instructors. To begin with
an interface for the login of learner drivers and driving instructors is created, which
functions:

When driving instructors create a new learner driver, this is automatically assigned to the respective
driving instructor.
Driving instructors who register for the first time can either create a new
company with the name of the driving school and the head of this driving school
or register with an existing driving school.

If learner drivers cancel driving lessons, driving instructors can release the corresponding
release the corresponding "timeslots". The learner drivers are then notified that they can register for these free timeslots.
can register for these free timeslots. In addition, vehicles and trailers that
shared can be booked via the app.

This app will significantly reduce the administrative workload at driving schools and improve
communication between learner drivers and driving instructors. The efficient
and vehicle management, the driving school will become more productive and better organized.
